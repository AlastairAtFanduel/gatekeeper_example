Done:

Can inspect routes and pull out:
    * path
    * name
    * verb
    * path params
    * query params
    * client depenencies
    * status codes returned
    * handler doc
    * document doc

Request call stacks:  Every request in debug mode records client methods called params etc.

Automatic lru_caching of client calls

    

ToDo:

* itegrate with sphinx
* graphvis generate call graphs with params
* more work todo on param docers
* more work todo on docer heirary
* timers
* Check responses instead of just status codes
* Werkzeug could populate path_handler
